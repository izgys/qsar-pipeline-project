# QSAR Pipeline for Molecular Bioactivity Prediction

**Author:** Iker Zapirain Gysling  
**Project Type:** Cheminformatics + Machine Learning + Drug Discovery  

**Status:** 🚧 In Progress  

---

## Project Overview

This project builds a complete QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship) pipeline to predict molecular bioactivity from chemical structure. 

Using real data from the **ChEMBL database**, molecular structures are processed into descriptors and fingerprints with **RDKit**, modeled with **scikit-learn**, and evaluated for predictive performance.

The entire workflow is designed as a clean, modular, and portfolio-quality example of applying machine learning in drug discovery.

## Objectives

- Extract and clean real-world bioactivity data from **ChEMBL**
- Generate molecular descriptors and fingerprints using **RDKit**
- Train machine learning models (regression/classification) with **scikit-learn**
- Evaluate performance using metrics and visualizations
- Organize project for reproducibility and GitHub presentation

## Target Protein

- **Target:** EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)  
- **ChEMBL ID:** [CHEMBL203](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/target_report_card/CHEMBL203/)
- **Why this target?** EGFR is a well-known cancer drug target with extensive experimental data available — ideal for QSAR modeling.

## Key Analyses

- **Distribution of activity values** (e.g., IC50, pIC50)
- **Feature importance in ML models**
- **Model metrics**: R², MAE, RMSE (regression) or accuracy, precision, ROC (classification)
- **Descriptor vs. Fingerprint performance comparison**
- **Data cleaning impact and molecule counts**

## Future Improvements

- Add support for additional targets from ChEMBL
- Include advanced ML techniques (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost)
- Extend pipeline to classification tasks (active/inactive)
- Package as a command-line tool or Streamlit app for demo
