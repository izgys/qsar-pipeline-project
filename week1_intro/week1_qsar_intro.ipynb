    "Your version (edited):\n",
    "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models are regression or classification models used to predict biological activity based on physical and chemical properties of molecules.\n",
    "QSAR involves selecting molecular descriptors (quantitative features), analyzing their correlation with a known biological activity, and training predictive models.\n",
    "The key steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset selection and descriptor extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Model construction (regression or classification)\n",

    "1. What is a descriptor?\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Your answer is good: a descriptor is a numerical value representing a molecular property (e.g., molecular weight, LogP, number of hydrogen bond donors, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a fingerprint?\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Your answer is in the right direction, but needs to be clearer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A fingerprint is a bit vector or binary array encoding the presence/absence of specific substructures or features in a molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike descriptors, which are often numeric values, fingerprints are like molecular \"barcodes\" used for similarity comparison or ML input.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìò Example: A 1024-bit fingerprint where bit 103 = 1 might mean the molecule has a benzene ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What does a QSAR model predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Correct: It predicts a quantitative or qualitative biological property, such as activity, toxicity, or binding affinity, based on structural features."
